Execute main.py to start the following process:
1) Simulate the interaction of a user with smart home and collect seperately the data of what the user and machine do in each second
2) Transfer these data to the monitoring unit that assigns inputs (user's actions) to the corresponding output (machine's reaction) based on specific rules. We get datapoints of "events" for each second
3) Apply the mathematical model of Surprise on these datapoints to decide which event was surprising for the user.
4) Output all surprising event with details about input/output, time and amount of surprise
